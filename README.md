DEPRECATED
==========

I've stoped using Angular and haven't updated this in a long time.

Consider using [ngannotate-rails](https://github.com/kikonen/ngannotate-rails) instead, which makes use of [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) which [possibly supercedes ngmin](https://github.com/btford/ngmin/issues/93).  I'm really not sure, but it looks good :)
